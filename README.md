### Analysis:
####	How do sales vary by day of the week and hour of the day?
- By Hour of the Day: The "Quantity ordered based on hours" graph shows that sales start to  increase around 7 AM, peak significantly between 9 AM and 10 AM, then gradually decline throughout the afternoon and evening. 
- By Day of the Week: The "Orders and Sales based on Days" graph shows the relative variation. However, we can observe the visual height of the bars for each day (Sunday through Saturday) to understand the trend. Generally, all days appear to have a similar order and sales volume based on the bar heights, with slight variations, which explains that  weekends have fewer sales and orders as compared to weekdays.
#### Are there any peak times for sales activity?
Yes, the peak time for sales activity is clearly between 9 AM and 10 AM, as indicated by the "Quantity ordered based on hours" graph, where the ordered quantity reaches its highest point.
#### What is the total sales revenue for each month?
The dashboard shows "Month Name" as a slicer, which filters sales per month. The month of June is having  the highest sales- $166,485.88,  and February has having the least sales- $ 76,145.19
#### How do sales vary across different store locations?
Sales vary significantly across different store locations, as shown in the "Footfall and Sales over various store location" chart.
- Astoria appears to have the highest sales.
-	Hell's Kitchen has sales comparable to Astoria.
-	Lower Manhattan has considerably lower sales compared to Astoria and Hell's Kitchen.
#### What is the average price/order per person?
The dashboard provides "Average Bill/Person" as $4.7. Therefore, the average price per order per person is $4.7.
#### Which products are the best-selling in terms of Category and revenue?
- In terms of Revenue (or high-value sales): The "Top 5 Product Sales" chart indicates that Gourmet Espresso is the best-selling product, generating the highest revenue among the top 5, followed by Brewed Chai Tea and Gourmet Coffee.
-	In terms of Quantity (based on overall categories):  The "Categories % Distribution based on Sales" pie chart indicates that Coffee (as a category) accounts for the largest percentage of sales at 39%, suggesting it's the best-selling category in terms of overall contribution.
